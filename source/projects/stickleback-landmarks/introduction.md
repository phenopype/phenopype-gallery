## Background

Functional morphology of organisms is often measured by placing landmarks at specific points that show structural, functional or developmental significance. Lake and stream ecotypes of threespine stickleback differ in their morphology: lake stickleback posess elongated spines and a set of tall bony lateral plates that cover most of the body, whereas stream ecotypes have shorter spines and a reduced plate coverage - i.e., fewer and shorter plates, as reviewed in [Hudson et al. (2021)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2020.611672/full).
