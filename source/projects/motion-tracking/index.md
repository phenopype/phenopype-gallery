# Motion tracking

Use the motion tracking module of phenopype to record movement of a prey population (isopods) in response to a stickleback, and create movement profiles of individuals using the trackpy library.

## Background

This example features analysis of predator-prey interactions of one threespine stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) and 20 benthic isopods (*Asellus aquaticus*). The goal is to extract movement trajectories of both species in response to each other, to see if isopods are reacting to the fish, and the other way round. At the same time, isopod pigmentation is measured in every frame to measure whether the fish has preferences for a particular phenotype (dark vs. light pigmentation, large bodied individuals).
